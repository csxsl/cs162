1 Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable.Which of the address from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable,and which segment/section is each defined in?
main 0x4005c2 in section .text
recur 0x40057d in section .text
static data 0x601048 in section .data
2 Make a list of the important segment,and what they are used for (look up their names on the Interat if you don't know)
text:code segment contains executable instructions
initialized data:contains global variables and static variables
bss:unitialized data segment, contains unitialized global and staic variables
3 What direction is the stack growing in?
down/low address
4 How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
48 byte
5 Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
0xab9010 up/high address
6 Are the two malloc() ed memory areas contiguous?
not contiguous, buf1 size is 100 byte ,howerver , the distance of buf1 and buf2 is 112
